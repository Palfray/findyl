# Record Store Day 2026: A Survival Guide

Record Store Day falls on Saturday 18 April this year. Over 300 independent record shops across the UK and Ireland will open their doors early, stock their shelves with more than 350 exclusive releases, and watch queues form that would make a Taylor Swift ticket sale look civilised. It is, without question, the best day of the year to be a vinyl collector. It can also be the most frustrating.

This guide is everything you need to know to get the most out of RSD 2026: making your wish list, surviving the queue, and knowing when to walk away.

## What actually is Record Store Day?

For the uninitiated: Record Store Day is a single-day global event, now in its 19th year, where artists and labels release exclusive vinyl pressings that are only available from participating independent record shops. Not HMV. Not Amazon. Your local indie shop, and only your local indie shop. (At least until 8pm on Monday 20 April, when any leftover stock goes online.)

The releases are limited, first-come-first-served, and cannot be pre-ordered or reserved. Shops aren't allowed to hold copies for anyone, no matter how loyal a customer you are. That's the deal: if you want it, you turn up.

Bruno Mars is this year's global RSD ambassador, following in the footsteps of Taylor Swift, Metallica, Jack White and Post Malone. He's marking the occasion with *The Collaborations*, a compilation of his biggest partnerships pressed as an exclusive RSD release. It brings together "Uptown Funk" with Mark Ronson, "Die With a Smile" with Lady Gaga and "APT." with ROSÉ.

## The 2026 releases worth knowing about

The full list runs to over 350 titles across every genre you can think of. Here are the ones that will have people setting alarms.

[Blur](/results?q=Blur)'s *Live at the Budokan* is getting a vinyl re-release for its 30th anniversary. It captures the band's 1995 Japanese tour, back when they were at the absolute peak of the Britpop wars. If you know anyone who still argues about Blur vs [Oasis](/artist?name=Oasis&id=39ab1aed-75e0-3571-8453-3099a39801f0), this is an excellent provocation.

[Paramore](/results?q=Paramore)'s *All We Know Is Falling* returns as a deluxe red double LP. Their 2005 debut hasn't been easy to find on vinyl for years, and this expanded edition adds enough to justify the upgrade even if you own an original.

[Charli XCX](/results?q=Charli+XCX) contributes "Party 4U" on seven-inch single, a deep cut for the *brat* crowd. [Suede](/results?q=Suede)'s *Coming Up* gets a BBC live performance on pink vinyl, which is the kind of sentence that would have made the NME combust in 1996.

[David Bowie](/results?q=David+Bowie) fans have two options: a neon pink 12-inch of "Hallo Spaceboy" and a half-speed pressing of excerpts from *1.OUTSIDE*, the sprawling, underrated album he made with Brian Eno. Eno is the producer and ambient music pioneer who helped shape Bowie's Berlin trilogy in the late seventies. Half-speed mastering is a process where the cutting lathe runs at half its normal speed, allowing the engineer to carve more detail into the grooves. Done well, the result is audibly cleaner and more dynamic than a standard pressing.

[Muse](/results?q=Muse) are reissuing their pre-fame EPs, which have been out of print for years and currently fetch serious money on the second-hand market. [The Cure](/results?q=The+Cure), [Fleetwood Mac](/artist?name=Fleetwood+Mac&id=e21857d5-3256-4547-afb3-4b6ded592596), [Madonna](/results?q=Madonna), [Elton John](/results?q=Elton+John), [Wolf Alice](/results?q=Wolf+Alice), [Sleep Token](/results?q=Sleep+Token), [RAYE](/results?q=RAYE), [Olivia Dean](/results?q=Olivia+Dean) and [CMAT](/results?q=CMAT) all have exclusive releases too.

Fifteen of this year's titles are in aid of War Child, the charity supporting children affected by conflict. Each of those releases donates £1 per unit sold. Artists on the War Child list include The Cure, Fleetwood Mac, Primal Scream, The Streets, Divorce, The Vaccines and Sigrid & Bring Me the Horizon.

## Make a list. Then make a shorter list.

This is the single most important piece of advice for RSD. The full release list is overwhelming. Over 350 titles, many of which you'll convince yourself you need at 11pm the night before. You won't get them all. No shop stocks every release. Your wallet doesn't stretch that far. And impulse buys at RSD have a way of gathering dust.

Here's how to plan:

Browse the full list at [recordstoreday.co.uk](https://www.recordstoreday.co.uk/rsd-list) and make a long list of everything that catches your eye. Then cut it down. Hard. Split what remains into three tiers: records you'll be genuinely gutted to miss, records you'd love but could live without, and records you'll pick up if they're still on the shelf when you get to the front. Three to five records in that top tier is realistic. Ten is setting yourself up for disappointment.

Once you've got your list, call your local shop. Most participating stores are happy to tell you which releases they've ordered and roughly how many copies they're expecting. This isn't reserving (they can't hold anything for you), but it tells you whether you're queuing at the right shop. If your number one pick is a niche jazz reissue pressed in quantities of 500, the massive Rough Trade flagship is probably a safer bet than a tiny shop that ordered two copies. Conversely, if you're after something popular, a smaller shop with a shorter queue might be your best shot.

## The queue: how early is early enough?

There is no universal answer to this, because it depends entirely on your shop, your city, and what you're after. But here are some benchmarks.

For big-name shops in London, Manchester, Bristol or Edinburgh, the queue can start forming before dawn. Rough Trade's UK stores open at 8am on RSD, and people will be outside well before that. For a smaller independent in a market town, arriving 30 to 45 minutes before opening is usually enough to be near the front. Some shops, particularly in smaller communities, barely have a queue at all, and you can stroll in mid-morning and still find plenty of stock.

The overnight queue exists, but it's rarer than the internet would have you believe. It tends to happen at a handful of high-profile London shops and isn't necessary for 99% of collectors at 99% of shops.

Bring a flask of coffee. Bring a friend who'll hold your spot if you need a toilet. Bring a phone charger. Bring cash as a backup in case card machines buckle under the pressure of several hundred transactions before 10am (it happens). And wear layers. April in the UK is not to be trusted.

## What happens when the doors open

Most shops operate a controlled entry system. They'll let a manageable number of people in at a time, often operating a one-in-one-out policy once the shop hits capacity. Expect to wait even after the doors open. Be patient with staff. They've been up since before you and will be on their feet until closing. They deserve your patience and your thanks.

RSD exclusives are almost always kept behind the counter. You won't be rifling through crates for them. Instead, you'll tell staff what you're after and they'll check if it's still in stock. This is where that prioritised wish list pays off. You need to know what you want, in order of importance, and be ready to rattle it off. Staff won't have time for you to stand there scrolling through your phone trying to remember whether you wanted the Bowie 12-inch or the Bowie half-speed.

One copy of each release per customer. Don't try to buy multiples of the same title. Shops enforce this, and attempting it is the fastest way to make yourself unpopular with both staff and the people behind you in the queue.

## The flipping question

Here's the uncomfortable bit. Within hours of Record Store Day, exclusive releases start appearing on eBay and Discogs at two, three, sometimes five times what they cost in the shop. People buy multiple copies from different stores, or send friends to buy on their behalf, specifically to resell at a markup. This is flipping, and it is one of the most reliably heated debates in vinyl collecting.

findyl's position: buy records you want to own, play and keep. If you miss out on something and the resale price on Discogs makes you wince, wait. Many RSD titles get wider represses within a year. The ones that don't tend to be genuinely limited, and you can decide at that point whether the secondary market price is worth it to you. What you probably shouldn't do is panic-buy from a reseller at 2pm on the day itself. Prices are at their most inflated in the hours immediately after RSD, and they almost always come down.

The shops themselves hate flipping. It undermines the entire point of the event, which is to get music into the hands of people who'll actually listen to it. Buying a record to leave sealed in a cupboard for six months before listing it for triple the price is, on a spiritual level, the opposite of what vinyl is for.

## If you miss out

Not everything sells out. In fact, most releases don't. The really limited titles go fast, but plenty of stock is still available mid-afternoon and into the evening. If you weren't near the front of the queue, it's still worth going. You might not get the one thing you had your heart set on, but you'll almost certainly find something you didn't know you wanted.

Anything unsold goes online on Monday 20 April at 8pm. Most participating shops put their remaining RSD stock on their websites simultaneously. This is your second chance, and it's worth setting a reminder.

Beyond that, keep an eye on findyl. We index stock from multiple UK retailers, and RSD releases that make it into general circulation will show up across our price comparison as they land. If a title gets a wider repress later in the year, you'll be able to compare prices across shops rather than paying whatever the first reseller asks.

## Beyond the exclusives

Record Store Day isn't just about the exclusive releases. It's about the shops themselves. Many stores run events all day: live performances, DJ sets, food, drink, sometimes genuinely surreal community moments. The atmosphere in a good record shop on RSD is unlike anything else in retail. People are happy. Staff are buzzing. Someone you've never met will recommend an album that changes your week.

Use the day as an excuse to visit a shop you've never been to. findyl's [local store finder](/local-stores) covers over 285 independent record shops across the UK and Ireland. There's almost certainly one near you that you've been meaning to check out.

Dig through the regular stock while you're there. The best thing about a record shop isn't the limited editions behind the counter — it's the £8 second-hand copy of something you've never heard that turns out to be the best record you buy all year.
