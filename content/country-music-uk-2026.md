# Country Music Is Taking Over the UK and These Are the Artists You Need on Vinyl

[Zach Bryan](/artist?name=Zach+Bryan&id=51e90731-08c0-4f60-89b6-5b78e5844de8) is playing Anfield. That sentence would have been a joke five years ago. [Garth Brooks](/artist?name=Garth+Brooks&id=b76645c5-78b0-4e4c-8f95-003f40013a45) is headlining BST Hyde Park. Brooks sold more albums in 1990s America than anyone except the Beatles, and now he's doing a Sunday evening in London like it's perfectly normal. And an eighteen-year-old from Arkansas who recorded his debut EP in his parents' rec room is about to play the O2.

This isn't a blip. UK country consumption grew 10.9% last year — the fastest growth of any major music market in the world. Country's share of the UK singles market has doubled to 3.3% in just two years, its highest this century. And with 7.6 million vinyl LPs sold in the UK in 2025 for the eighteenth consecutive year of growth, the timing for country collectors couldn't be better.

2026 is the year country music stops being something that happens *over there* and becomes unmissable *over here*. These are the artists driving it — and the records worth owning.

## The Stadium Shows

[Zach Bryan](/artist?name=Zach+Bryan&id=51e90731-08c0-4f60-89b6-5b78e5844de8) started out recording songs on his phone while serving in the US Navy. Now he's booked Liverpool's Anfield, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for two nights (June 12–13), Edinburgh's Murrayfield, and Belfast's Boucher Road. His album *The Great American Bar Scene* features collaborations with Bruce Springsteen and John Mayer, and the vinyl pressings have been consistently excellent — warm, dynamic, and worth every penny over the digital version.

[Luke Combs](/artist?name=Luke+Combs&id=c20ee61f-071f-4e65-9c81-45ee931a54ce) has that rare combination of everyman charm and a voice that could knock a wall down. He brings his tour to Wembley Stadium and Edinburgh's Murrayfield in late July and early August. Then there's [Garth Brooks](/artist?name=Garth+Brooks&id=b76645c5-78b0-4e4c-8f95-003f40013a45) at BST Hyde Park on June 27. Brooks famously kept his catalogue off streaming services for years, which means his vinyl back catalogue carries extra weight — if you want to hear *No Fences* or *Ropin' the Wind*, physical is still the purest way in.

These are proper stadium shows for artists who, not long ago, would have struggled to sell out Shepherd's Bush Empire. When [Morgan Wallen](/artist?name=Morgan+Wallen&id=2077273e-eaa1-4f49-903c-f286ededecb9) played BST Hyde Park in 2024, he drew 50,000 people — a UK record for a country act. The ceiling keeps rising.

## Tyler Childers — the Vinyl Collector's Pick

If you're going to fall for one country artist this year, make it [Tyler Childers](/artist?name=Tyler+Childers&id=9947e874-ddd0-4e1a-b0d4-a76f6532fe45). The Kentucky singer-songwriter plays Glasgow's OVO Hydro on March 6 and Manchester's AO Arena on March 8, and if you can get tickets, you should.

His songs are quiet enough to demand your full attention, which makes them perfect for vinyl. The songwriting draws from the Appalachian storytelling tradition — front-porch fiddle and gut-punch lyricism — but there's a restlessness to his work that keeps pushing into bluegrass, soul, and even funk. His 2024 album *Snipe Hunter* was produced by Sturgill Simpson, a fellow Kentuckian who's equally allergic to staying in one lane. It's the sound of a musician who knows exactly who he is but hasn't finished finding out what he can do.

Start with *Purgatory* if you're new. It costs about fifteen quid, it's one of the best country debut albums of the last twenty years, and it sounds better on wax than it does on Spotify. Then work forward.

## Charley Crockett — Gulf & Western

[Charley Crockett](/artist?name=Charley+Crockett&id=cf391be8-a609-4fcf-8de1-0eff6b639ae5) has released thirteen-plus albums in roughly eight years. Thirteen. He's from San Benito, Texas, right on the Mexican border, and he blends country, blues, soul, and Cajun into something he calls "Gulf & Western." It's a perfect name. His music sounds like a jukebox in a Gulf Coast roadhouse where the neon's been on since 1967.

*$10 Cowboy* and *The Man From Waco* are both superb entry points. *The Man From Waco* plays like a lost country soundtrack, complete with spaghetti-western guitar and a voice that sits somewhere between George Jones and Charles Bradley, the soul singer who found fame in his sixties after decades of obscurity. No confirmed UK dates yet for 2026, but Crockett's back catalogue is deep and affordable on vinyl. You could spend a month in there.

## Ella Langley — the Breakout

[Ella Langley](/artist?name=Ella+Langley&id=b16c0872-31a7-4db9-8569-0e3146fcecfc) is having a moment. Her duet with [Riley Green](/results?q=Riley+Green), "You Look Like You Love Me", was one of the biggest country songs of 2024. Her follow-up single "Choosin' Texas" — co-written with Miranda Lambert, one of Nashville's sharpest songwriters — has been sitting at the top of the UK Country Radio Airplay Chart for eleven non-consecutive weeks.

Her sophomore album *Dandelion* drops on April 10, 2026, and if the singles are anything to go by, this is the record that turns Langley from breakout act to established star. She's currently US-only for live dates — a 16-city Dandelion Tour kicks off in May with [Kaitlin Butts](/results?q=Kaitlin+Butts) among the support acts — but a UK visit feels like a matter of when, not if. Keep an eye on the vinyl pressings for *Dandelion*; country albums increasingly get the coloured-vinyl treatment, and a debut-era pressing from an artist on this trajectory tends to hold its value.

## Kaitlin Butts — Roadrunner!

[Kaitlin Butts](/results?q=Kaitlin+Butts) grew up on musical theatre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and you can hear it. There's a dramatic streak to her country music that you don't get from many of her contemporaries.

Her album *Roadrunner!* is a high-concept reimagining of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical *Oklahoma!*. On paper, that shouldn't work. In practice, it absolutely does. It's 17 tracks of outlaw country, rock 'n' roll, and sharp-as-glass songwriting. The producer is Oran Thornton (best known for his work with Brent Cobb). Pedal steel comes from Russ Pahl, who's played on records by Sturgill Simpson and Kacey Musgraves. Butts is playing Highways Festival at the Royal Albert Hall (May 15–17), and her song "You Ain't Gotta Die (To Be Dead To Me)" has 157 million views on TikTok, so expect the crowd to know every word.

## Sierra Ferrell — the Genre-Bender

[Sierra Ferrell](/artist?name=Sierra+Ferrell&id=4a27848e-ffdc-45d2-bed4-f5d62b85dc3e) is difficult to pin down. The West Virginia singer pulls from bluegrass, jazz, country, and something that can only be described as gypsy folk.

*Trail of Flowers* takes a couple of listens to click. The first time through, you're not sure what you're hearing — is this country? Jazz? Something your nan would have played? By the third listen, you're evangelising it to strangers. Her vinyl releases tend to get the deluxe treatment with beautiful packaging — vintage fashion on the covers, old-Hollywood glamour, the kind of object you want to own physically even before you drop the needle. One of those artists where the record on your shelf says something about you.

## The Next Generation — Bayker Blankenship & Waylon Wyatt

[Bayker Blankenship](/results?q=Bayker+Blankenship) is twenty. [Waylon Wyatt](/results?q=Waylon+Wyatt) is eighteen. Both are playing C2C (Country to Country, the UK's flagship country festival) at the O2 in London, Glasgow's OVO Hydro, and Belfast's SSE Arena from March 13–15.

Blankenship, from Livingston, Tennessee, taught himself guitar during the pandemic. He went from posting covers on TikTok to going Gold with "Maxed Out" in nine months. His collaboration with Wyatt, "Jailbreak," is approaching Gold certification with 72 million streams. He signed a record deal before most people his age have finished their first job.

Wyatt's story is even stranger. His debut EP *Til The Sun Goes Down* was recorded in his parents' rec room and has amassed over 225 million streams. "Arkansas Diamond" has already been certified Gold. The producer is Ian Fitchuk, who co-produced Kacey Musgraves' *Golden Hour* — the album that proved country could win Album of the Year at the Grammys. Fitchuk brings a clarity to Wyatt's recordings that makes them feel far more polished than their homemade origins might suggest. These two are building careers from their bedrooms and selling out arenas on two continents before their twentieth birthdays. Nashville didn't discover them. TikTok did.

## More Names to Know

[Wyatt Flores](/artist?name=Wyatt+Flores&id=4ae67eb7-c01c-4d71-b995-21b093fcb888)' debut *Welcome to the Plains* sounds like the Turnpike Troubadours (an Oklahoma red-dirt band widely regarded as one of the best live acts in Americana) fed through a Gen Z filter. [The Red Clay Strays](/results?q=Red+Clay+Strays) are an Alabama five-piece making the kind of Southern rock-meets-soul music that turns Chris Stapleton fans feral. [Dylan Gossett](/results?q=Dylan+Gossett) quit his job in Formula 1 to pursue music after "Coal" went viral on TikTok. [Flatland Cavalry](/results?q=Flatland+Cavalry), out of Lubbock, write songs that sound like driving through west Texas with the windows down.

All of them press beautiful vinyl. All of them are on findyl.

## Why Country and Vinyl Are a Perfect Match

Country albums tend to be carefully produced — real instruments, real dynamics, the kind of analogue warmth that vinyl captures well. The genre also has a deep tradition of treating the physical release as an event: gatefold sleeves, coloured variants, limited pressings, cover art you'd happily frame.

Newer artists like Zach Bryan and Tyler Childers get this instinctively. Their vinyl releases aren't afterthoughts; they're premium products for people who care about how music sounds and how it feels in their hands. And with the UK's vinyl market now accounting for 34% of all album sales, the country section of your collection doesn't have to stay thin for long.

*Purgatory* costs about fifteen quid. *The Great American Bar Scene* sounds better on wax than it does on Spotify. Start there.
