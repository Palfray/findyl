# Country Music Is Taking Over the UK — and These Are the Artists You Need on Vinyl

There's something happening in country music right now that would have seemed genuinely absurd a decade ago. [Zach Bryan](/artist?name=Zach+Bryan&id=51e90731-08c0-4f60-89b6-5b78e5844de8) is playing two nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. [Garth Brooks](/artist?name=Garth+Brooks&id=b76645c5-78b0-4e4c-8f95-003f40013a45) — the man who sold more albums in 1990s America than anyone except the Beatles — is headlining BST Hyde Park. And an eighteen-year-old from Arkansas who recorded his debut EP in his parents' rec room is about to play the O2.

This isn't a blip. UK country consumption grew 10.9% last year — the fastest growth of any major music market in the world. Country's share of the UK singles market has doubled to 3.3% in just two years, its highest this century. And with 7.6 million vinyl LPs sold in the UK in 2025 for the eighteenth consecutive year of growth, the timing for country collectors couldn't be better.

2026 is the year country music stops being something that happens *over there* and becomes unmissable *over here*. These are the artists driving it — and the records worth owning.

## The Stadium Shows

The sheer scale of country's UK presence in 2026 would have been unthinkable five years ago. [Zach Bryan](/artist?name=Zach+Bryan&id=51e90731-08c0-4f60-89b6-5b78e5844de8) — the former US Navy serviceman from Oklahoma whose self-released recordings turned him into the biggest new voice in American music — is playing two nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (June 12–13), plus Liverpool's Anfield, Edinburgh's Murrayfield, and Belfast's Boucher Road. His album *The Great American Bar Scene* features collaborations with Bruce Springsteen and John Mayer, and the vinyl pressings have been consistently excellent — warm, dynamic, and worth every penny over the digital version.

[Luke Combs](/artist?name=Luke+Combs&id=c20ee61f-071f-4e65-9c81-45ee931a54ce), the North Carolina singer whose everyman charm and wrecking-ball voice have made him one of the genre's most reliable arena-fillers, brings his tour to Wembley Stadium and Edinburgh's Murrayfield in late July and early August. And then there's [Garth Brooks](/artist?name=Garth+Brooks&id=b76645c5-78b0-4e4c-8f95-003f40013a45), headlining BST Hyde Park on June 27. Brooks famously kept his catalogue off streaming services for years, which means his vinyl back catalogue carries extra weight — if you want to hear *No Fences* or *Ropin' the Wind*, physical is still the purest way in.

These are proper stadium shows for artists who, not long ago, would have struggled to sell out Shepherd's Bush Empire. The demand is real. When [Morgan Wallen](/artist?name=Morgan+Wallen&id=2077273e-eaa1-4f49-903c-f286ededecb9) played BST Hyde Park in 2024, he drew 50,000 people — a UK record for a country act. The ceiling keeps rising.

## Tyler Childers — the Vinyl Collector's Pick

If you're going to fall for one country artist this year, make it [Tyler Childers](/artist?name=Tyler+Childers&id=9947e874-ddd0-4e1a-b0d4-a76f6532fe45). The Kentucky singer-songwriter plays Glasgow's OVO Hydro on March 6 and Manchester's AO Arena on March 8, and if you can get tickets, you absolutely should.

Childers makes the kind of music that rewards close, attentive listening — which is to say, he makes music that was built for vinyl. His songwriting draws from the Appalachian storytelling tradition, all front-porch fiddle and gut-punch lyricism, but there's a restlessness to his work that keeps pushing into bluegrass, soul, and even funk. His 2024 album *Snipe Hunter* — produced by Sturgill Simpson, another artist who refuses to stay in any single lane — is the sound of a musician who knows exactly who he is but hasn't finished finding out what he can do.

Start with *Purgatory* if you're new. It's one of the best country debut albums of the last twenty years, and the vinyl pressing sounds gorgeous. Then work forward.

## Charley Crockett — Gulf & Western

[Charley Crockett](/artist?name=Charley+Crockett&id=cf391be8-a609-4fcf-8de1-0eff6b639ae5) is the kind of artist who makes you wonder how you haven't heard of him yet. A singer from San Benito, Texas — right on the Mexican border — Crockett has released thirteen-plus albums in roughly eight years, blending country, blues, soul, and Cajun into something he calls "Gulf & Western." It's a perfect name. His music sounds like a jukebox in a Gulf Coast roadhouse where the neon's been on since 1967.

His records *$10 Cowboy* and *The Man From Waco* are both superb entry points — the latter plays like a lost country soundtrack, complete with spaghetti-western guitar and a voice that sits somewhere between George Jones and Charles Bradley (the soul singer who had a remarkable late-career renaissance in his sixties). No confirmed UK dates yet for 2026, but Crockett's back catalogue is deep, affordable on vinyl, and rewards exploration like few artists working today.

## Ella Langley — the Breakout

[Ella Langley](/artist?name=Ella+Langley&id=b16c0872-31a7-4db9-8569-0e3146fcecfc) is having a moment. Her duet with [Riley Green](/results?q=Riley+Green) — "You Look Like You Love Me" — was one of the biggest country songs of 2024, and her follow-up single "Choosin' Texas," co-written with Miranda Lambert (one of Nashville's sharpest songwriters and a formidable artist in her own right), has been sitting at the top of the UK Country Radio Airplay Chart for eleven non-consecutive weeks.

Her sophomore album *Dandelion* drops on April 10, 2026, and if the singles are anything to go by, this is the record that turns Langley from breakout act to established star. She's currently US-only for live dates — a 16-city Dandelion Tour kicks off in May with [Kaitlin Butts](/results?q=Kaitlin+Butts) among the support acts — but a UK visit feels like a matter of when, not if. Keep an eye on the vinyl pressings for *Dandelion*; country albums increasingly get the coloured-vinyl treatment, and a debut-era pressing from an artist on this trajectory tends to hold its value.

## Kaitlin Butts — Roadrunner!

Speaking of [Kaitlin Butts](/results?q=Kaitlin+Butts): if you're not already paying attention, now's the time. The Tulsa, Oklahoma singer brings a theatrical streak to country music that you don't hear from many of her contemporaries — she grew up on musical theatre and it shows, in the best possible way.

Her album *Roadrunner!* is a high-concept reimagining of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical *Oklahoma!*, which sounds like it shouldn't work at all, and then absolutely does. It's 17 tracks of outlaw country, rock 'n' roll, and sharp-as-glass songwriting, produced by Oran Thornton (the Nashville producer behind Brent Cobb's records) with musicians including Russ Pahl — a multi-instrumentalist whose pedal steel work has appeared on records by Sturgill Simpson and Kacey Musgraves. Butts is playing Highways Festival at the Royal Albert Hall (May 15–17), which is as good a UK introduction as any artist could ask for. Her song "You Ain't Gotta Die (To Be Dead To Me)" racked up 157 million views on TikTok, which gives you some idea of the momentum behind her.

## Sierra Ferrell — the Genre-Bender

[Sierra Ferrell](/artist?name=Sierra+Ferrell&id=4a27848e-ffdc-45d2-bed4-f5d62b85dc3e) is difficult to pin down, which is entirely the point. The West Virginia singer pulls from bluegrass, jazz, country, and something that can only be described as gypsy folk, and the result is music that sounds like it fell out of a time machine set to "all of them at once." Her album *Trail of Flowers* is warm, strange, and completely captivating — the kind of record you put on to impress a dinner guest and then can't stop listening to yourself.

Visually, Ferrell is striking — vintage fashion, old-Hollywood glamour, a stage presence that commands attention — and her vinyl releases tend to get the deluxe treatment with beautiful packaging. She's one of those artists whose records you want to own physically, not just because they sound better on wax, but because the whole object is gorgeous.

## The Next Generation — Bayker Blankenship & Waylon Wyatt

Here's where it gets genuinely exciting. [Bayker Blankenship](/results?q=Bayker+Blankenship) and [Waylon Wyatt](/results?q=Waylon+Wyatt) are both playing C2C — Country to Country, the UK's flagship country festival — at the O2 in London, Glasgow's OVO Hydro, and Belfast's SSE Arena from March 13–15. Blankenship is twenty. Wyatt is eighteen. Both are already making music that would be impressive from artists twice their age.

Blankenship, from Livingston, Tennessee, went from posting guitar covers on TikTok to going Gold with "Maxed Out" — a raw, heartfelt ballad about being broke and holding on — in just nine months. His collaboration with Wyatt, "Jailbreak," is approaching Gold certification with 72 million streams and counting. He taught himself guitar during the pandemic, started playing bar shows around town, and signed a record deal before most people his age have finished their first job.

Wyatt, from Arkansas, might be even more remarkable. His debut EP *Til The Sun Goes Down* was recorded in his parents' rec room and has amassed over 225 million streams. "Arkansas Diamond" has already been certified Gold. His producer, Ian Fitchuk — the Grammy-winning musician who co-produced Kacey Musgraves' *Golden Hour*, the album that essentially proved country could win Album of the Year at the Grammys — brings a clarity and warmth to Wyatt's recordings that makes them feel far more polished than their homemade origins might suggest.

Both artists represent something genuinely new: a generation of country musicians who grew up on TikTok, built their audiences without the traditional Nashville machinery, and are now selling out venues on two continents before their twentieth birthdays.

## More Names to Know

The country wave doesn't stop there. [Wyatt Flores](/artist?name=Wyatt+Flores&id=4ae67eb7-c01c-4d71-b995-21b093fcb888), the Oklahoma singer-songwriter whose debut album *Welcome to the Plains* channels the Turnpike Troubadours — an Oklahoma red-dirt band widely regarded as one of the best live acts in Americana — into something urgently modern. [The Red Clay Strays](/results?q=Red+Clay+Strays), an Alabama five-piece who blend Southern rock, soul, and country into something that makes Chris Stapleton fans lose their minds. [Dylan Gossett](/results?q=Dylan+Gossett), the Texan who quit his Formula 1 job to pursue music after his song "Coal" went viral on TikTok. [Flatland Cavalry](/results?q=Flatland+Cavalry), the Lubbock band whose rolling, anthemic sound captures the wide-open Texas landscape better than almost anyone.

All of them are worth exploring on findyl. All of them press beautiful vinyl. And all of them are part of a movement that's only getting bigger.

## Why Country and Vinyl Are a Perfect Match

There's a reason country music and vinyl work so well together. Country albums tend to be carefully produced, with real instruments, real dynamics, and the kind of analogue warmth that vinyl captures beautifully. The genre also has a deep tradition of treating the physical release as an event — gatefold sleeves, coloured variants, limited pressings, beautiful cover art.

Newer artists like Zach Bryan and Tyler Childers understand this instinctively. Their vinyl releases aren't afterthoughts; they're premium products designed for people who care about how music sounds and how it feels in their hands. And with the UK's vinyl market continuing to grow — now accounting for 34% of all album sales — there has never been a better time to build a country collection.

Whether you're picking up *Purgatory* on a Friday afternoon or hunting for a coloured pressing of *The Great American Bar Scene*, these are records that reward the investment. Country music has arrived in the UK. Your turntable is ready.
