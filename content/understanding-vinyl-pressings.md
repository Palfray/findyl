# Understanding Vinyl Pressings — 180g, Coloured, First Pressing Explained

Every vinyl listing throws terms at you. 180g audiophile pressing. Limited edition splatter. Remastered from the original tapes. First pressing. Gatefold. Half-speed mastered. You're expected to know what all of it means and, more importantly, whether any of it is worth paying extra for.

Some of it genuinely matters. Some of it is marketing dressed up as quality. And some of it sits annoyingly in between. Here's what you actually need to know.

## The weight question: what does 180g mean?

Pick up a record from the 1970s and one from this year. The new one probably feels heavier. That's because most modern vinyl is pressed at 180 grams — roughly 30–50% heavier than the 120–150g pressings that were standard for most of the 20th century.

The number refers to the weight of the disc itself. A heavier record is thicker, stiffer, and sits more securely on your turntable platter. It's also less likely to warp if your storage isn't perfect, which — if you've ever stacked records horizontally during a house move and spent the next week trying not to think about it — is worth something.

What 180g doesn't automatically mean is better sound. The grooves on a 180g pressing are cut to exactly the same specifications as those on a lighter record. The cutting engineer determines groove depth, not the weight of the disc. A 120g pressing from 1975 and a 180g reissue from 2025 could sound identical, completely different, or — and this is the outcome nobody talks about — the older one could sound better.

The reason 180g pressings often *do* sound good has nothing to do with the weight itself. When a label invests in a 180g pressing, they tend to invest in everything else too: a quality remaster, better source material, a reputable pressing plant. The weight is a signal that someone cared about the product. But it's just a signal. A poorly mastered album pressed on 180g vinyl is still a poorly mastered album. It's just a heavier one.

The practical benefits are real, though. Heavier records are more durable. They're less prone to warping. They feel substantial in your hands — and in a format where the physical experience is half the point, that counts. If you're choosing between a 140g and 180g version of the same album at a similar price, go heavier. But don't pay a premium for weight alone.

One thing worth knowing: thicker records raise the playing surface slightly higher on your platter. If you've got a turntable with adjustable VTA (vertical tracking angle — the angle at which your stylus meets the groove), you might want to tweak it when switching between lightweight vintage records and modern 180g pressings. If that sentence meant nothing to you, don't worry — most modern turntables handle this fine without adjustment.

## Coloured vinyl: does it sound different?

Short answer: on a modern pressing from a decent plant, probably not in any way you'd notice.

Longer answer: it's complicated, and the complications are interesting.

All vinyl records start life as PVC pellets — the same colourless plastic regardless of what the finished record looks like. To make standard black vinyl, manufacturers add carbon black, which strengthens the PVC and gives it anti-static properties. To make coloured vinyl, they use dyes instead. These dyes have different chemical properties to carbon black, which can — in theory — affect how consistently the grooves are formed during pressing.

Twenty years ago, this was a real issue. Coloured vinyl had a deserved reputation for higher surface noise and faster wear. But pressing technology has improved enormously since then. Modern single-colour pressings — your solid reds, blues, translucent greens — are generally indistinguishable from black vinyl in listening tests. The pressing plant matters far more than the colour.

There's a hierarchy, though. Solid, opaque colours tend to be the most consistent. Translucent colours (clear blue, smoke grey) usually perform well too. Where things get slightly less predictable is with multi-colour effects — splatter, marble, swirl — because the multiple pigments create more variables during pressing. The results can still sound excellent, but there's a wider margin for inconsistency. Picture discs sit at the bottom of the quality scale. The image is sandwiched between thin layers of vinyl, which means shallower grooves and more surface noise. They're collectors' items, not listening copies. Buy them for the shelf, not the turntable.

If you're choosing between a standard black pressing and a coloured variant of the same album, the honest advice is: buy whichever one you prefer looking at. On any well-pressed modern record, you're unlikely to hear a difference. And there's something to be said for dropping a deep red [*Rumours*](/artist?name=Fleetwood+Mac&id=bd13909f-1c20-4e16-a1dd-e1a3baf23187) or a transparent blue [*AM*](/artist?name=Arctic+Monkeys&id=ada7a83c-e3e1-40f1-93f9-3e73571f6e43) onto the platter and watching it spin.

## First pressings vs reissues: what's the difference?

A first pressing is exactly what it sounds like — the initial batch of records produced when an album is released. A reissue is any subsequent pressing made after that first run, whether that's six months later or six decades later.

Collectors prize first pressings. They tend to cost more, sometimes dramatically more. A first pressing of [*The Dark Side of the Moon*](/artist?name=Pink+Floyd&id=83d91898-7763-47d7-b03b-b92132571559) from 1973 will set you back considerably more than a 2023 remaster. The question is: does the extra money buy you better sound?

Sometimes. But not for the reason most people assume.

The sound of a vinyl record is determined primarily by the mastering — the process of transferring a recording onto the lacquer disc that will be used to create the stampers that press the records. A first pressing uses the original mastering, which was done close to the time of recording, often by an engineer who worked directly with the artist. That directness can produce a pressing with real character and warmth.

But mastering technology has improved considerably over the decades. A 2025 reissue of a 1970s album might use better equipment, more refined techniques, and — crucially — access to source material that's been better preserved. Kevin Gray, one of the most respected mastering engineers working today, has remastered hundreds of classic albums for audiophile labels like Analogue Productions and Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (known as MoFi). His work is sought after precisely because modern mastering can bring out details that the original process missed.

Then there's the pressing itself. A major album's "first pressing" in the 1970s might have involved multiple pressing plants across several countries, each producing slightly different results from different sets of stampers. Two copies of the same first pressing from different plants could sound noticeably different. Meanwhile, a modern reissue pressed in a single run at a quality plant like Optimal Media in Germany or GZ Media in the Czech Republic — two of the largest and most respected pressing plants in Europe — might be more consistent than any pressing from the original era.

The honest answer is: it depends on the specific album, the specific pressing, and what you value. First pressings carry historical weight and collectible value. They're the version that existed when the music was new. But a well-done modern reissue can sound better — and it'll cost a fraction of the price.

If you're curious about which pressing of a particular album sounds best, the community at Discogs and the Steve Hoffman Music Forums are obsessively detailed about this stuff. For popular albums like [*Rumours*](/artist?name=Fleetwood+Mac&id=bd13909f-1c20-4e16-a1dd-e1a3baf23187) or [*OK Computer*](/artist?name=Radiohead&id=a74b1b7f-71a5-4011-9441-d0b5e4122711), someone has almost certainly compared every pressing ever made.

## Half-speed mastering: the premium option

You'll see this on releases from labels like Abbey Road Studios' Half-Speed Mastering series and Mobile Fidelity's One-Step process. The concept is straightforward: instead of cutting the lacquer master at the normal speed (33⅓ RPM), the engineer cuts it at half speed (16⅔ RPM). The playback tape also runs at half speed, so everything stays in sync.

Why bother? At half speed, the cutting lathe has twice as long to carve each groove. This allows for greater precision, particularly in the high frequencies, where the grooves are finest and most difficult to cut accurately. The result — when done well — is a pressing with noticeably improved detail, separation, and dynamic range.

It's not a magic bullet. Half-speed mastering won't fix a poor recording. And because the process costs more to produce, these releases typically carry a higher price tag — often £30–40 for a single LP. But on well-recorded albums, the difference can be striking. [Miles Davis](/artist?name=Miles+Davis&id=561d854a-6a28-4aa7-8c99-571f5ab36e13)' *Kind of Blue* in half-speed, or [Pink Floyd](/artist?name=Pink+Floyd&id=83d91898-7763-47d7-b03b-b92132571559)'s *Wish You Were Here* from the Abbey Road series, are the kind of pressings that make you hear things in albums you thought you knew inside out.

## Gatefold, OBI strip, and other packaging terms

These come up constantly in vinyl listings and they're simpler than they sound.

**Gatefold** means the sleeve opens like a book. Instead of sliding the record into a single pocket, you open two connected panels — often revealing lyrics, extra artwork, band photos, or liner notes inside. Gatefolds became iconic in the late 1960s and 70s, when progressive rock bands used the extra real estate for elaborate artwork. [Led Zeppelin](/artist?name=Led+Zeppelin&id=678d88b2-87b0-403b-b63d-5da7465aecc3)'s *Physical Graffiti*, with its die-cut building facade, is one of the most celebrated examples. Today, gatefolds are standard for most premium releases and double LPs, though single-disc albums get the treatment too. It's a nicer experience. You're paying for the physical object as much as the music, and a gatefold makes the physical object worth spending time with.

**OBI strip** is the paper band wrapped around the spine of the sleeve. It originated in Japan, where record shops used OBI strips to display pricing and track listings in Japanese for imported Western albums. Over time, the OBI became a design element in its own right — and a collectible one. Japanese pressings with intact OBI strips command premium prices, and some modern releases include OBI strips as a nod to that tradition. The strip adds nothing to the sound, but if you've ever seen a Japanese pressing of [*Abbey Road*](/artist?name=The+Beatles&id=b10bbbfc-cf9e-42e0-be17-e2c3e1d2600d) with its original OBI intact, you'll understand the appeal.

**Inner sleeves** are the sleeves that hold the record inside the outer jacket. They come in three types: basic paper (the kind your records probably came in), paper with a poly-lined interior (smoother, less likely to scratch), and full anti-static poly sleeves (clear plastic, the gold standard for protection). Upgrading your inner sleeves is one of the cheapest and most effective things you can do for your collection. A pack of MoFi-style poly sleeves costs a few quid and will keep your records in better condition than any amount of careful handling.

**Remastered** means the original recording has been processed again — typically with updated equipment and techniques — to create a new master. Remastering can improve clarity, dynamic range, and overall sound quality, but it can also go wrong. Some remasters push the volume too loud (the so-called "loudness war"), losing the dynamics that made the original great. A remastered pressing isn't automatically better. Check reviews if you're spending serious money.

## What actually determines how a record sounds

If you take one thing from this guide, make it this: the weight, the colour, and the edition matter far less than the chain of decisions that got the music into those grooves.

The recording quality comes first — a brilliantly captured performance will sound good on practically any format. Then the mastering, where an engineer shapes how that recording translates to vinyl. Then the pressing plant, where the physical disc is manufactured. Then the condition of the stampers, which degrade over long runs. Then, right at the end, the weight and colour of the vinyl itself.

A superbly mastered, well-pressed 140g black record will always sound better than a lazily mastered 180g coloured special edition. Always. The sticker on the front of the shrink wrap can't tell you how an album sounds. The people who made it can.

That said — and this is the part that keeps collectors coming back — when everything in that chain is done right, the result is extraordinary. A well-pressed vinyl record, played on a decent turntable, through a reasonable pair of speakers, fills a room in a way that no other format quite matches. The format rewards attention. The terminology exists because the details matter. Not all of them matter equally, but the good ones make a real difference.

Now you know which ones to pay attention to.
