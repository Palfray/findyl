# Vinyl Record Grading Guide: What the Grades Actually Mean and How Not to Get Burned

You've found a record you want. It's listed as "VG+" on Discogs. It's £18 plus postage. The seller has decent feedback. You click buy.

It arrives three days later. You slide it out of the mailer, flip the sleeve over, and there it is. A seam split running the full length of the spine. Two scratches visible without even holding it to the light. A previous owner has helpfully written "DAVE" across the label in biro.

This is not VG+. This is not VG+ anywhere on Earth.

If you've bought used vinyl online, this has happened to you. Maybe not this dramatically, but the sinking feeling of opening a record that's been graded by someone who either doesn't understand the system or is hoping you won't complain is a universal collector experience. The good news: once you know how grading actually works, you can spot the red flags before you buy and know exactly where you stand if something arrives wrong.

## Two Systems, One Endless Argument

Here's the thing nobody tells you upfront: there isn't one grading system. There are two, and if you're buying vinyl in the UK, you'll run into both of them constantly.

The **Goldmine Grading Standard** was created by the American magazine of the same name back in 1974. It's what Discogs uses, and it's become the default for most online selling worldwide. The grades run: Mint, Near Mint, Very Good Plus, Very Good, Good Plus, Good, Fair, Poor.

The **Record Collector Grading System** comes from the UK magazine *Record Collector*, which launched in 1980 and became the bible for British vinyl collectors. Its grades run: Mint, Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor, Bad.

Spot the difference? Record Collector uses "Excellent" where Goldmine uses "Very Good Plus". They describe roughly the same condition: a record that's been played but well cared for, with minimal impact on sound. The problem is that both systems also use "Very Good", but they mean very different things by it.

A Goldmine VG record has been played a fair bit. There's audible surface noise, maybe some light pops and clicks, but it plays through without skipping. A Record Collector VG record is worse. It's been "played many times" with "noticeable surface marks and the occasional light scratch". Functionally, a UK seller's VG is closer to a Goldmine Good or Good Plus.

This matters because when a UK-based eBay seller lists a record as "VG+", they might be using the Record Collector scale, in which case VG+ sits between Excellent and Very Good, roughly equivalent to a lower-end Goldmine VG+. Or they might be using the Goldmine scale. Or they might be using no scale at all and just think the record looks alright. The grade alone doesn't tell you which system someone's using, and that ambiguity is where most buying disappointments come from.

## The Grades, Translated into Plain English

Let's go through each grade in the Goldmine system (since that's what Discogs uses and what you'll encounter most often online), but with honest descriptions of what to actually expect when the record lands on your doormat.

**Mint (M)**

The record has never been played. Full stop. It might still be sealed, or it's been opened but never put on a turntable. The sleeve is immaculate. No ring wear, no creasing, no writing, no stickers. You will almost never see a genuinely Mint record unless it's a recent release still in shrinkwrap, and even then, factory defects can mean a sealed record isn't truly Mint. If someone is selling a 1970s pressing of [*Rumours*](/artist?name=Fleetwood+Mac&id=bd13909f-1c20-4e16-a1dd-e1a3baf23187) as Mint and it's not sealed, be very sceptical.

**Near Mint (NM or M-)**

The record looks like it came from a shop and was opened for the first time. It's been played a couple of times at most, always with care, and shows no visible marks under normal light. The sleeve has no splits, no ring wear, no writing. Most reputable dealers won't grade anything higher than NM, because admitting that no record is ever truly perfect is a sign that someone knows what they're doing.

What to expect: A record that looks and sounds essentially new. If it has any surface noise at all, you'd struggle to hear it. This is collector grade, the condition serious buyers aim for.

**Very Good Plus (VG+)**

This is where the money grade lives, and where the arguments start. A VG+ record has been played and enjoyed, but looked after. Under a bright light, you might see some light marks where it's been slid in and out of the sleeve, but nothing that catches your fingernail. It plays cleanly, with maybe the faintest hint of surface noise in the quietest passages. The sleeve might have a tiny bit of wear at the edges or corners, but nothing dramatic.

What to expect: A very good-sounding record that most listeners would be completely happy with. For all but the most obsessive collectors, VG+ is the sweet spot: good enough to sound great, affordable enough to actually buy.

**Very Good (VG)**

Now we're into records that have been properly lived with. A VG record has visible scratches, the kind you can see without squinting. You'll hear surface noise, some pops and clicks, especially in quieter sections and during intros and fades. But it plays through without skipping. The sleeve might have writing on it, ring wear from the record pressing against the cover, or a seam split along the bottom or spine.

What to expect: A record that sounds like a used record. For everyday listening (background music, cooking, having people round) a VG record is perfectly fine. For focused, headphones-on listening, the surface noise will be noticeable. For rare or expensive records, VG might be the best condition you can realistically find and afford.

**Good Plus (G+) and Good (G)**

A Good record has been played to death and shows it. Significant surface noise, audible scratches, possibly some distortion on louder passages. The sleeve is battered. These records are cheap for a reason, but they still play through without skipping. That's the floor for a "Good" grade.

What to expect: A record for filling gaps in a collection until a better copy comes along. If you're after a rare album that costs three figures in VG+ and you just want to hear the music, a Good copy for a fiver has its place. Just know what you're getting.

**Fair (F) and Poor (P)**

The record may skip. It may be warped. The sleeve may be held together by optimism and a strip of yellowing tape. These grades exist so that extremely rare records still have a market even when they're in terrible shape. A Poor copy of a genuinely scarce first pressing is still a [first pressing](/articles/understanding-vinyl-pressings), and to some collectors, that matters more than how it sounds. For everything else, avoid.

## Sleeve and Disc: Two Separate Grades

One thing that trips up newer buyers: the record and the sleeve are graded separately. You'll often see grades written as a pair, like "VG+/VG", which means the sleeve is VG+ and the disc is VG (sleeve always comes first). Some sellers reverse this convention, so if the listing doesn't specify which is which, ask before you buy.

This separation matters because a pristine record in a battered sleeve is a very different proposition from a scratched record in a beautiful sleeve. For listening purposes, the disc grade is what counts. But if you care about the full package (the artwork, the gatefold, the liner notes, the complete object) the sleeve grade matters too.

A quick note on inner sleeves: if the original inner sleeve (the one with lyrics or artwork printed on it) has been replaced with a plain paper or poly-lined sleeve, that's usually a sign the previous owner cared about the record. It's a good thing for the disc, even if the original inner is missing. For more on why inner sleeves matter, see our [guide to storing vinyl properly](/articles/how-to-store-vinyl-records).

## How to Buy Used Vinyl Without Getting Burned

Grading is subjective. Even experienced dealers disagree on whether a record is VG+ or NM. But there are patterns you can spot, and habits that will save you money and disappointment.

**On Discogs**

Discogs officially uses the Goldmine standard, but not every seller follows it, particularly UK sellers who grew up with the Record Collector system. Look at the seller's notes, not just the grade. A seller who writes "light hairlines visible under direct light, plays with very occasional light tick on side B" is telling you more than a grade ever could. That kind of honesty is a green flag. If the only description is "VG+" with nothing else, that's not necessarily a red flag, but it gives you nothing to work with if the record arrives in worse condition than expected.

Check the seller's feedback and pay attention to complaints about grading specifically. A seller with 99.5% positive feedback and 2,000 sales is a safer bet than one with 100% and 12 sales. Volume plus consistency equals reliability.

**On eBay**

eBay is the Wild West of vinyl grading. Sellers range from professional dealers with deep knowledge to someone clearing out their dad's attic who thinks "it looks fine" constitutes a grade. The condition dropdown (New, Like New, Very Good, Good, Acceptable) maps loosely to grading standards, but plenty of sellers ignore it or use it incorrectly.

Photos are your best friend here. A seller who photographs the actual record, both sides, under good light, is giving you the information you need to make your own assessment. A seller who uses stock images or photographs the record from three feet away on a dark carpet is not your friend.

UK buyers on eBay have consumer protection through the Consumer Contracts Regulations. If a record is "not as described", the seller must accept a return and cover return postage. In practice, enforcement relies on eBay's resolution centre, which can be slow. But knowing your rights means you can push back with confidence when something arrives overgraded.

**At Record Fairs and In Shops**

This is where grading becomes less relevant because you can see and often play the record yourself. Tilt the disc under a light source. If scratches catch the light but don't catch your fingernail when you run it across the groove, they're surface marks and probably won't affect playback. If you can feel the scratch with your nail, it'll likely produce an audible click or pop on every rotation.

Check the sleeve edges, the spine, and the bottom seam. These are the first places to show wear. Flip to the back and check for writing, price stickers, or cut-out notches (a small hole or cut in the corner, common on US promos and overstock). None of these affect how the record sounds, but they affect value.

If a shop lets you play before you buy, listen to the first 30 seconds and the last 30 seconds of each side. That's where surface noise and tracking issues are most obvious. Our [local record store directory](/local-stores) covers over 285 independent shops across the UK, and most of them will let you inspect before you buy.

**General Rules**

A conservative grader is a trustworthy grader. If a seller describes a record as VG+ but it arrives looking NM, you've found someone worth buying from again. If a seller calls everything Near Mint, treat every listing with suspicion.

Don't confuse visual grading with play grading. A record that looks rough might play beautifully. Old records can accumulate cosmetic marks from decades of sleeve removal without any groove damage. Conversely, a record that looks clean can have been tracked with a worn stylus, grinding away the groove walls in a way that's invisible to the eye but immediately audible. Visual grading is a starting point, not a verdict.

Clean before you judge. A record that sounds crackly and rough might just be dirty. A proper clean — even a basic wet clean with distilled water and a microfibre cloth — can transform a record from "disappointing" to "why was this so cheap?" We cover everything from quick pre-play routines to full deep cleans in our [vinyl cleaning guide](/articles/how-to-clean-vinyl-records).

## What the Grades Are Worth

There's no universal pricing formula, but here's a rough guide to how condition affects price relative to Near Mint:

Near Mint commands the full asking price. VG+ typically sells for around 50–60% of Near Mint value. VG drops to about 25–30%. Good is 10–15% at best. Below Good, records are worth whatever someone's willing to pay for the rarity alone.

These ratios shift for rare or collectable records. A first pressing of [*In the Court of the Crimson King*](/artist?name=King+Crimson&id=b38225b8-8e5f-42aa-bcdc-3a5f19939f74) in VG might still cost more than a modern reissue in NM, because the pressing itself carries value beyond the music. For common albums that have been reissued multiple times — your [*Dark Side of the Moon*](/artist?name=Pink+Floyd&id=83d91898-7763-47d7-b03b-b92132571559), your [*Abbey Road*](/artist?name=The+Beatles&id=b10bbbfc-cf9e-42e0-be17-e2c3e1d2600d) — buying a used VG copy rarely makes financial sense when a new pressing costs £20–25. Unless the used copy is an original pressing you specifically want.

## The Short Version

Grading exists to give buyers and sellers a shared language for describing condition. It's imperfect, it varies between systems and between individuals, and it's no substitute for photos, detailed descriptions, and a seller you trust. But understanding what the grades mean — and crucially, what they mean on the specific platform you're buying from — is the difference between building a collection you're proud of and a shelf full of expensive disappointments.

When in doubt: ask. A good seller will always provide more detail if you request it. And if they won't, buy from someone who will.
