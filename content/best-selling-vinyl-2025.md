# The Best-Selling Vinyl Records in the UK in 2025

UK vinyl sales hit 7.6 million units in 2025 — up 13.3% year-on-year and marking an 18th consecutive year of growth for the format. That's an extra 900,000 records sold compared to 2024, according to new analysis from the BPI.

Taylor Swift topped the list for the fourth year running. Sam Fender broke records for a British artist. And Oasis — because of course — landed two albums in the top ten off the back of anniversary pressings alone.

Here's the full rundown of the UK's biggest-selling vinyl albums and singles of 2025, based on Official Charts Company data.

## Taylor Swift — still the undisputed vinyl queen

*The Life of a Showgirl* sold 147,000 copies on vinyl in 2025 — more than her two closest rivals combined. 125,000 of those came in the opening week alone, making it the fastest-selling vinyl album of the century. It's Swift's twelfth studio album, and her fourth consecutive year as the UK's biggest vinyl seller, following *Midnights* (2022), *1989 (Taylor's Version)* (2023) and *The Tortured Poets Department* (2024).

She also placed fourth with *Lover (Live From Paris)*, which shifted 47,000 vinyl copies after a Valentine's Day re-release helped it top the Official Albums Chart for the first time.

## Sam Fender — the biggest British vinyl album of the year

*People Watching* landed at number two with 73,000 vinyl sales. 43,000 of those came in week one — the biggest opening week for a British artist on vinyl this century. It's Fender's third UK number one album, and the kind of figure that suggests his audience isn't just streaming — they're collecting.

## Oasis — 30 years on, still shifting vinyl

Anniversary pressings of *(What's the Story) Morning Glory?* and *Definitely Maybe* earned Oasis two spots in the top ten. *Morning Glory* placed third with 55,000 sales; *Definitely Maybe* rounded out the top ten at 30,000. Coloured vinyl reissues of *Whatever* and *Some Might Say* also topped the vinyl singles chart.

## Beyond the top 10

The rest of the top 40 tells a broader story. Radiohead placed three albums (*OK Computer* at 11, *In Rainbows* at 17, *The Bends* at 26) — a reminder that their catalogue remains vinyl-collecting essential territory. Arctic Monkeys had two entries. Jeff Buckley's *Grace* continues its improbable run at 19.

New releases held their own too. Pulp's *More* — their first number one in 27 years — landed at 14. Lady Gaga's *Mayhem* at 15. Wolf Alice's *The Clearing* at 18. Sleep Token, Dave, Wet Leg and Lorde all featured in the top 40, proving this isn't a chart dominated by nostalgia alone.

## Coloured vinyl and limited editions

The singles chart in particular highlights how much coloured and limited-edition vinyl is driving sales. Oasis's *Whatever* was reissued on pink and blue splatter vinyl. Swift's *Fortnight* came out on grey vinyl for Record Store Day. Chappell Roan's *The Giver* was available in five different coloured editions and debuted at number one on the Vinyl Singles Chart.

This trend isn't slowing down. The coloured vinyl segment is growing at 9.5% annually worldwide, with limited colourways growing at 21%. For collectors, the variant hunt has become part of the appeal.

## What this means for collectors

The market is healthy, growing, and increasingly driven by new releases rather than catalogue reissues alone. If you're buying vinyl in the UK, you're part of a 7.6-million-strong community — and the range of what's selling suggests there's genuine demand across genres, not just pop.

For price-conscious buyers, the lesson is clear: popular new releases often appear across multiple UK retailers at different price points, especially during the first few weeks. Comparing prices before buying — particularly on limited editions that carry a premium — can save you a meaningful amount over the course of a year's collecting.
